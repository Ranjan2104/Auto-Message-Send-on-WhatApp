The language is perfect for automation. The first automation I tried was email automation. Then web scraping, and now WhatsApp messages.

Perhaps you want a WhatsApp message to deliver at a particular time but you could be busy or even at sleep at that time. Or you may want to know how you can automate WhatsApp messages just for the fun of it.

In this article, you will learn how to automate WhatsApp messages with two lines of Python code.

Install Python, Pycharm, and Pywhatkit if you haven’t already.

How to Automate WhatsApp Messages With Python

In the process of writing your code, you may come across bugs but don’t fret. I will cover below how you can solve bugs likely to come up. If the bugs you see are not mentioned here, search for the solution on Google.

Bugs are part of programming. I couldn’t get over a bug I encountered while trying to automate my WhatsApp messages. I had to sleep over it before I could solve it. It is always good to sleep over some bugs. You’re refreshed the next morning and ready to solve the damn bugs.

Now let’s dive in.

    Open Pycharm and create a new project. Give your new project a name — Whatsautomation or any name you prefer. Then select python file. Also, give the python file a name you want.
    Google Pywhatkit or go to the website here. Copy the Pywhatkit installation link. You will see the link where the red arrow is pointed in the diagram below. Click on it and the link will be copied.
